repo for 17jul homework, a dashboard for weather display

What's the weather? We ask ourselves that every time we get ready to head out of our homes and it has never been easier to find out. Using my Weather Dashboard, deployed here ,by searching the city, state, country or region you are looking for in the search column, you will see the weather results on the right.

Below the search bar you will also notice a search history. Just click on any location you have searched in the past and the current results will populate for you without needing to re type your city name.

This weather dashboard app utilizes the Open Weather Map api to display temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index as well as a 5 day forecast of temp and humidity. The app does this by using JavaScript to call to the api, then generates all of the HTML elements that house all of the data we are calling for. After displaying the data in the HTML file, it listens for a click on a new search, previously searched location, or clearing your history. One interesting thing about this api I like in particular is that you can search for a location's past name, for instance Burma results Myanmar and Saigon results Ho Chi Minh City so even a Greek settler from 300BC could find his weather in Antioch If this app is useful to you please feel free to look at my other repos.
